            <p>Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the waters, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. However, in recent times, due to the quickly expanding human population, there have been new, intense pressures that have made it harder for sea turtles to survive. Five primary risks to sea turtles globally have been recognized by the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group:<b>coastal development, pollution and climate change.</b></p>

                  <h2>coastal development</h2>
                  <p>Every year, sea turtle habitats are destroyed because of shrinking coastlines. Wherever there is boat vessel traffic, whenever a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and wherever there is sea floor dredging and beach erosion sea turtle food supplies and nesting areas take a major hit. <br> Actions to prevent - Protect Coastlines,  support turtle friendly tourism and learn the rules of the beach</br></p>

                  <h2>Pollution and pathogens</h2>
                  <p> Marine pollution can harm sea turtles in many ways. Plastic pollution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and other debris injure sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Ocean pollution can also weaken the turtles’ immune systems, and disrupt nesting behavior and hatchling orientation. <br> Actions to prevent - reduce pollution, reduce, reuse, recycle, and consider a product’s entire life </br></p>

                  <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                  <p>We are just now learning the extent to which climate change can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs. <br> Actions to prevent - fight climate change and reduce your carbon footprint. </br></p>
